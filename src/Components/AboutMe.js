                    Hi I'm Pahlovi! I have loved photography since I was a teenager growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, plastering fashion spreads from W
                    Magazine all over my bedroom walls. I went on to work in the fashion industry in Milan, Italy for several years and then lived in Paris,
                    France, before coming to Montana in the early 90â€™s to settle down and raise a family. I love to play tennis, travel and enjoy everything
                    beautiful Montana has to offer with my family.
