                            Difference between SQL and NoSQL?

                            SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
                            tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.SQL databases
                            are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores.

                        <AccordionBody>
                            JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
                            contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
                            cannot be altered after the token is issued.WTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used
                            to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand.

                        <AccordionBody>
                            NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. It is built with the concept of event-driven architecture.
                            It has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.
